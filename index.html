    <h1>Hello, I'm Gratch</h1>
    <p>I am a 1.5 year old terrier mix. I was found as a stray on the mean streets of Fresno when I was just 4 months old.</p>
    <p>I was sent to a shelter in Portland, OR where my mommy, Kristen, adopted me. I am a happy-go-lucky guy with
      tons of energy.</p>
    <h2>Here are some other things about me:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>My mom is my favorite person in the whole world. I am obsessed with her.</li>
      <li>I love to go to the dog park and play chase with all the other doggies</li>
      <li>I'm a huge fan of tug-o-war</li>
      <li>I'm not so great at fetch (I sometimes forget to bring the ball back with me after I chase it)</li>
      <li>My favorite place to be is snuggled up under a blankie with my mom</li>
      <li>I am incredibly spoiled and get a lot of treats. My favorites, in order, are:
        <ol>
          <li>Pig ears</li>
          <li>Chicken Jerky</li>
          <li>DentaSticks</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now you know all about me. I hope you enjoyed my page!</p>
